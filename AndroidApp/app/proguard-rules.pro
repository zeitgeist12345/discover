# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# --- Rules for Gson ---

# Keep the Link data class (used in ApiService.getWebsites) and its members for Gson
-keep class com.example.discover.data.Link { *; }
-keepclassmembers class com.example.discover.data.Link { *; }

# Keep the LinkGson data class and its members for Gson (if you use it for Gson parsing anywhere)
# If LinkGson is not used with Gson, you can remove these two lines.
-keep class com.example.discover.data.LinkGson { *; }
-keepclassmembers class com.example.discover.data.LinkGson { *; }

# General Gson rules that are good to have.
# These help Gson with reflection, especially if you use @SerializedName or generic types.

# Keep annotations and attributes Gson might need.
-keepattributes Signature
-keepattributes InnerClasses
-keepattributes *Annotation*

# For keeping fields annotated with @SerializedName (you use this in Link for createdAt)
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}

# Keep constructors for classes that Gson needs to instantiate.
# This is often implicitly covered by `-keep class ... { *; }`
# but can be made more explicit if needed for complex scenarios.
# For typical data classes, the above rules are usually sufficient.

# If you use enums with @SerializedName for custom serialized values:
-keepclassmembers enum * {
    @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}

# --- End of Rules for Gson ---
